# Why

Currently I'm really excited about writing clean codes, so that I created this repository to practice design patterns, SOLID and tdd using Java Spring boot(What I'm also learning). 

# Required

- A text editor or IDE for Java.
- JDK 1.8 or later.
- Maven 3.2+

# How to run

- Open the project folder with your IDE.
- Config your IDE to use Spring boot.
  - [@Eclipse](https://dzone.com/articles/creating-a-spring-boot-project-with-eclipse-and-ma)  **recommended**
  - [@Intellij](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/spring-boot.html)
- Run the project and test requesting on "localhost:8080/clients" on your browser.
